                                                             **LECTURE 02**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1. Variables**
* variable is used to store data in key-value format
```
Name = Kastro
Age = 30
Gender = Male
```
* They acts as placeholders for values that can be used throughout the script
* variables doesn't require explicit data type declarations
* A variable can store any type of value
* Accessing variable - use `$` symbol to access the value of a variable `$<VariableName>`

```sh
export course=ShellScripting
echo $course
```
* **Types of variables;**
    - System variable
    - User define variables 
**1. System (Environment) Variables** - predefined by the system. The variables which are already defined and used by our system are called as System Variables
Ex: `$USER, $HOME, $PATH`

To see all the system variables; env

**2. User defined Variables** - created by user based on the requirement

Temporary variables - are created using 'export' command. These variables cannot be accessed once the terminal closes. the assigned values to the variable will be lost

**Permanent variables** - even if i lose connection to the terminal, the values assigned to a variable will still be available

* How to make a variable as a permanent?
	- .bashrc
	- source .bashrc

* How to see the variables available in the .bashrc file
	- cat -n .bashrc

To remove a variable
unset <VariableName>

**Points to remember;**
1. Cannot start with a digit (Ex: 123Kastro, 611Kiran)
2. Cannot contain 3 special characters (- @ #) (Ex: Kastro-, Kiran@, Trainer#)
3. Use UPPERCASE for environment variables and lowercase for user-defined variables. But it is not mandatory


## 2. Operators
Operator is used to perform any task execution

**Types of operators;**
* 2.1. Arithmetic Operators: To perform mathematical operations
Operators: + - * / %

Syntax: $ ( (expression) ) 

Add two numbers;
100 and 300
echo $ ( ( 100 + 300 ) ) ----> Output: 400

* example-1
```bash
#! /bin/bash

# Adding Two Numbers

num1=500
num2=600
SUM=$((num1+num2))
echo "The result is: $SUM"
```

* example-2
```bash
#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter Num1"
read Num1
echo "Enter Num2"
read Num2
echo "Enter Num3"
read Num3
echo "The sum is $((Num1+Num2+Num3))"

```
* example-3
```bash
#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter Two Numbers"
read num1
read num2

#Multiple Operation 
sum=$((num1+num2))
diff=$((num1-num2))
prod=$((num1*num2))
division=$((num1/num2))

# Display the results 
echo "Sum is $sum"
echo "Difference is $diff"
echo "Product is $prod"
echo "Division is $division"

```



* **2.2. Relational or Comparison operators:**
* - To compare two values. it is used to compare values in conditional statements
- Operators:
	Equal to				: == or eq
	Not equal to			: !=
	Greater than			: > or gt
	Greater than or equal	: >= or ge
	Less than				: < or lt
	Less than or equal		: <= or le

**Syntax:**
```
if [ condition ]; then
	#Statements
elif [ condition ]; then
	#Statements.
else [ condition ]; then
	#Statements
fi
```
* exapmle-1
```bash
#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter two Numbers"
read num1
read num2

if [ $num1 == $num2 ]; then
	echo "$num1 is equal to $num2"
elif [ $num1 > $num2 ]; then
	echo "$num1 is greater then $num2"
else 
	echo "$num1 is less then $num2"
fi
```
## 3. Conditional statements 
- used to execute the commands based on conditions
Syntax:
```
if [ condition ]; then
	#Statements
elif [ condition ]; then
	#Statements.
else [ condition ]; then
	#Statements
fi
```
* example-1
```bash
#! /bin/bash
# To check the password length 
# Week: lessthan 8 chars
# Moderate: 8-12 chars
# Strong: greaterthan 12 chars 

echo "Enter the password"
read password

length=${#password}

if [ $length -lt 8 ]; then
	echo "Your password is Week - Lessthan 8 charc"
elif [ $length -ge 8 ] && [ $length -lt 12 ]; than
	echo "Your password is moderate - Between 8-12 charc"
else 
	echo "your Password is Strong - More than 12 charc"
fi

```
A - 90-100
B - 80-89
C - 70-79
D - 60-69
E - Below 60


**Assignment:**
Task 1:
Write a shell file to check whether a file is available or not in a specific path

Output: The <FileName> is available in <Path>
 
Task 2:
Write a shell file to check what is the file type (whether it is a directory or a normal file)

Output:  "The <Name> is a Normal File" (if its a file), otherwise it should print "The <Name> is a directory"
