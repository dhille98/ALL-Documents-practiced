"welcome to shell Scripting"

if you want to print a message for multiple times we will use 'Loop' concept 

* what is loop?
  - Loops are used to executed the same statement multiple times 
  - used to repeat a set of commands until a condition is satisfied 

**Types of Loops;**

1. Range based loop
   - if you already know how many times you want to execute a statement then we will use 'Range based loop'
       - ex: for 
2. Conditional based loop 
    - if you dont know the range and you want to execute a statement until the condition the is true then we will use 'Conditional based loop'
        ex: while 

FOR Loop
--------
syntax 

```
for (( initialization; condition; modification )) 
    do
    <Statements>
done
```
* example-1: i want to print number from 1-15

```bash
#! /bin/bash

for(( i=1; i<=15; i++))
do
    echo $i
done

```
* example-2 : find the files exit or not and print the files 

```sh
#! /bin/bash

for file in *.txt; do
    echo "Text file name: $file"
done 
```

WHILE Loop
----------
while loop is used to execute until the condition is true

Syntax
```
while [ condition ]
do
	<Statements>
done
```
* examples-1

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Ask for a password unitill the correct password is enterd 
password="secret"
user_input=""
while ["$user_input" != "$password" ]
do
    echo "Enter Correct Password:"
    read user_input
done
echo "Access Granted!!"
```
* example-2

```sh
#!/bin/bash

k=I
while [$k -le 15 ]
do 
    echo $k
    let k++

done 
```

* example-3

```sh
#! /bin/bash
#Countdown Loop File
counter=5
while [ $counter -ge 1 ]; do
    echo "Countdown: $counter"
    counter=$((counter -1))
    sleep 2
done 
echo "Bomb is Blasted"
```

Assignment:
Task 1: For loop: Create a directory and Write a shell script file to print all the .py, .java and .txt files available in custom directory path

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the directory path is provided
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <directory_path>"
    exit 1
fi

DIRECTORY=$1

# Check if the directory exists
if [ ! -d "$DIRECTORY" ]; then
    echo "Error: Directory '$DIRECTORY' does not exist."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Listing all .py, .java, and .txt files in: $DIRECTORY"

# Loop through files and print matching ones
for file in "$DIRECTORY"/*.{py,java,txt}; do
    # Check if files exist (in case no matching files are found)
    if [ -e "$file" ]; then
        echo "$file"
    fi
done

```
Task 2: For loop: Write a shell file to Print Even Numbers from 2 to 20

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Even numbers from 2 to 20:"

# Loop from 2 to 20 with step 2
for ((num=2; num<=20; num+=2)); do
    echo "$num"
done

```
Task 3: While loop: Write a shell file to Monitor CPU Usage in Real-Time

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Interval in seconds
INTERVAL=5

echo "Monitoring CPU Usage (Press CTRL+C to stop)..."

while true; do
    # Get the CPU usage using 'top' command (works on Linux)
    CPU_USAGE=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')
    
    # Print CPU usage
    echo "CPU Usage: $CPU_USAGE%"

    # Wait for the specified interval
    sleep $INTERVAL
done

```
* find the number is even or odd 
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read a number from the user
read -p "Enter a number: " num

# Check if the number is even or odd
if (( num % 2 == 0 )); then
    echo "$num is Even"
else
    echo "$num is Odd"
fi

```
